# Outline

https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt/commit/0860db76f8cbaa7dae551f7800f5480593a2ec95

* Extensions have been very successful
* Show a couple recent extensions, thank contributors
* People wanted to use extensions from other extensions https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt/issues/3472
* This is great because it makes all extensions easier to write. See the local_output extension for example https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-extensions/tree/master/local_output
* So we made it happen, now extensions can be loaded from other extensions!
