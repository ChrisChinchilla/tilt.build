# Tilt Up and Ship

## Tilt makes it possible to develop all your microservices locally in Kubernetes.

Write a Tiltfile script that describes how your services fit together. Share it
with your team so that any engineer can hack on any server. See a complete view
of your system, from building to deploying to logging to crashing.

Get Tilt

### Keep your local development tools

Edit in your IDE, save to your filesystem. No commit or push required. Tilt
watches the filesystem and updates your servers in seconds. Tilt can update your
servers on Docker For Mac, Minikube, or your favorite Kubernetes cluster.

### Share the workflow that keeps you in-flow

Any engineer just runs ‘tilt up’ to see the app live at http://localhost/. No
more “it worked on my machine”: everything runs in containers so the right
dependencies are always there. Tilt updates with container optimization tricks &
best practices, so that even complex projects update in seconds.

### Find your way in a maze of microservices

Stop playing 20 questions with kubectl each time your app misbehaves. Tilt
collects problems from across tools and services into one UI. One place to see
build breakages, yaml typos, crash loops, and request exceptions.
